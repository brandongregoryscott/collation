# Rules

This plugin implements various different rules to make your code more consistent and easier to read, with the idea that **all rules should be fixable**.

:wrench: if some problems reported by the rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` command line option

:warning: if some problems reported by the rule are manually fixable by editor suggestions
