# Alphabetize Enums

## Name

`alphabetize-enums`

## Description

Alphabetizes members of an enum by key.

## Example

### String values

```ts
enum Animals {
    Dog = "dog",
    Wolf = "wolf",
    Cat = "cat",
}
```

will be transformed to:

```ts
enum Animals {
    Cat = "cat",
    Dog = "dog",
    Wolf = "wolf",
}
```

### Numeric values

```ts
enum SortOrder {
    DESC = 0,
    ASC = 1,
}
```

will be transformed to:

```ts
enum SortOrder {
    ASC = 1,
    DESC = 0,
}
```

## Notes

Implicitly numeric enums are not currently supported since there might be code that is dependent on their values which are generated by the current order (i.e. enums that are used in a database table)

```ts
enum Animals {
    Dog, // Implicit value is 0
    Wolf, // Implicit value is 1
    Cat, // Implicit value is 2
}
```

Alphabetizing these members by key would change the underlying behavior of the enum which is unintended. See [`#1`](https://github.com/brandongregoryscott/collation/issues/1) for additional context.
